# Tone Review: Adjustments Made

## Guiding Principles Applied

✅ **Modest claims** - Changed definitive statements to suggestions
✅ **Respectful to readers** - Acknowledged expertise gaps and invited feedback
✅ **Professional but not obsequious** - Maintained confidence in the work while staying humble
✅ **No overreach** - Qualified strong claims with "appears," "suggests," "may"

## Specific Changes

### Root README
- "Critical Finding" → "Finding"
- "Models CAN learn" → "Models can learn"
- "proves" → "suggests"
- "This project is a case study" → "This project explores"
- Contributing note now explicitly invites experienced practitioners' insights

### Chapter 2
- "This isn't semantic understanding" → "This appears to be pattern matching"
- "The models haven't learned" → "The models appear to have learned"
- "models can't...They must" → "models can't...They would need to"
- "we'll have proven" → removed prescriptive language about what Chapter 3 would prove
- "models must be tested" → "Testing...can reveal"

### Chapter 3
- "This proves" → "This suggests"
- "Yes, models can learn" → "These results suggest that models can learn"
- "makes it worthwhile" → "may be worthwhile"
- "demonstrates" → "shows" or "suggests" (in two places)

### Chapter 1
- "demonstrates that" → "shows that" or "suggests that"
- Maintained existing modest language

## Result

All documentation now:
- Presents findings as observations rather than absolute truths
- Invites scrutiny and alternative interpretations
- Acknowledges the exploratory nature of the work
- Respects readers' expertise without being obsequious

Appropriate for presenting to experienced ML researchers and practitioners.
